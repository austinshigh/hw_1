    <h1>My name is Austin</h1>
    <h2>I hail from Lancaster, Pennsylvania!</h2>
    <h3>HExt Major, Software Engineering</h3>
    <div>I currently work for Scholastic Publishing as a Front-End Software Engineer. All of my teams projects are web applications. I have about 2 years of experience working on web applications professionally!</div>
    <div>I have taken some very good software design courses with HExt. The Software Design capstone was by far my favorite. I worked with a non-profit 'WildTrack' to develop a new image uploading application for them.</div>
    <div>I wanted to take this course because while I use HTML, CSS, JQuery, and sometimes React at work, I have had no formal training in React. All of my training has been self-taught on the job. So I am looking forward to covering the React framework more thoroughly.</div>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/n1pnXr2/Garage-Shelf.jpg" alt="Garage-Shelf"> <div>I love building things! And even more so, I love building things with my family and friends. This is a picture of some garage shelves that I built with my sister for a neighbor</div>
    <div>Rice And Noodles is my favorite restaurant. It is located in my hometown (Lancaster,PA). Check it out below!</div>
